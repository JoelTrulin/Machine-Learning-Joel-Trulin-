       " 'Patients and Methods \\nOne hundred and fifty-seven patients entered this open trial. They all showed skin lesions of apparently fungal origin associated with inflammatory symptoms. \\nThe lesions dated from four days to ten years. \\nEighty patients out of 157 were known to have been previously treated for their condition before they entered the trial. Above 44 different preparations had been prescribed a total of 126 times to these 80 patients. \\nThe results of this previous treatment were recorded in 72 patients as follows : marked improvement but with subsequent relapse in 6 ; moderate improvement in 8 ; minimal improvement in 24 ; no improvement in 34. \\nConfirmation of the clinical diagnosis was sought by direct microscopical examination and by culture of skin scrapings from all patients except 15 with eczema marginatum and one with candidosis, fungi being obviously the pathogenic agents. \\nSamples were cultured on Sabouraud PS\" and PSA mediums at 25° C. A few samples were additionally cultured on bacterial mediums. \\nRAll the patients were instructed to apply Daktacort cream twice daily to the affected area, and to come back for examination at two-week intervals. Duration of treatment varied according to the clinical results obtained. \\nThese results were scored as follows : cure (++), improvement (+), and insufficient clinical results (0). \\nResults \\nThe aetiology and localization of the lesions observed before RDaktacort treatment are given in Table 1. The 157 patients showed a total of 176 lesions. Feet (84 lesions), inguinocrural folds (43 lesions) and hands (23 lesions) were mostly involved. \\nDermatophytes were demonstrated in 72 lesions, yeasts in 23, gram-positive bacteria in 19, and gram-negative bacteria in 2. Samples from 44 lesions were negative for both fungi and bacteria on direct microscopical examination as well as on culture. As mentioned above, there were no samples taken from 16 patients. \\nRThe clinical results of the Daktacort treatment are given in Table 2. Regardless of the aetiology of the lesions, one hundred and thirty patients (83 %) out of 157 were scored cured after a median treatment duration of 4 weeks, the extremes being one week and 12 weeks. \\nAs regards the results according to the aetiology of the lesions, cures were observed in 89 % of the patients with fungal infections, in 67 % of the patients with gram-positive bacterial infections, and in 86 % of the patients from whom no pathogens were isolated ; the two patients with gram-negative bacterial infections (Pseudomonas sp. and Escherichia coli) only showed improvement and insufficient clinical results. \\nAdverse reactions \\nOnly one patient with balanitis due to St. albus and E. coli reported burning sensations and irritation after one week of topical treatment. \\nConcomitant treatment with miconazole nitrate tablets given orally \\nAfter final assessment, four patients received miconazole nitrate tablets (each containing 250 mg) orally in addition to the topical cream. \\nThe first patient with an erythematous lesion on the left cheek caused by Trichophyton rubrum received miconazole nitrate at a daily dose of 25 mg/kg of bodyweight from week 5 to week 7 of her topical treatment. She was rated cured from week 9 onwards. \\nThe second patient with an apparently fungal eczema of both feet was prescribed miconazole nitrate at a daily dose of 35 mg/kg of bodyweight. He was rated cured at the end of a two-week treatment. No pathogens could never be isolated from the lesions of this patient. \\nThe third patient with an eczema of the perianal region caused by Candida tropicalis was prescribed miconazole nitrate tablets at a daily dose of 25 mg/kg of bodyweight from week 4. A complete cure was attained at week 6. \\nThe fourth patient with a Trichophyton verrucosum infection of the wrist was given miconazole nitrate tablets at a daily dose of 25 mg/kg of bodyweight from week 2 to week 3. This patient dropped out after one week of oral treatment at which time no improvement was seen. \\nThere were no side-effects reported. \\nConclusions \\nRCures after topical treatment with Daktacort were achieved in 83 % of all patients : in 89 % of 93 patients with dermatophytic or yeast infections, in 67 % of the 9 patients with gram-positive bacterial infections, and in 86 % of the 44 patients from whom no pathogens were isolated. Response to treatment was poor in the two patients with gram-negative bacterial infections (Pseudomonas sp. and E. coli). \\nThese results are markedly superior to those recorded with previous treatments. \\nConcomitant oral treatment with miconazole nitrate seems to have contributed to the cure of three patients out of four. \\nSummary \\nA cream containing miconazole nitrate 2 % and hydrocortisone 1 % was prescribed to 157 outpatients with 176 lesions of apparently fungal origin associated with inflammatory symptoms. \\nOn admission, skin scrapings were taken from 141 patients for direct microscopical examination and/or culture. In the 16 other patients, the fungal origin of the lesions was clinically evident. \\nAll patients were instructed to apply the cream twice daily to the affected areas, and to come back for examination at two-weekly intervals. The median duration of treatment was four weeks. \\nCures were achieved in 93 of the 104 patients with single or mixed fungus infections, in 6 of the 9 patients with single or mixed gram-positive bacterial infections, and in 31 of the 42 patients in whom no pathogen could be demonstrated, No drug-related adverse reactions were observed. Concomitant oral treatment with miconazole nitrate seems to contribute to cure. \\n',\n",
       " 'Aussems and Van Cutsem (1974) conducted an open trial involving 157 outpatients with 176 lesions of apparently fungal origin associated with inflammatory symptoms. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Daktacort cream, which contains miconazole nitrate 2% and hydrocortisone 1%. Patients applied the cream twice daily to the affected areas for a median duration of four weeks. The clinical results were scored as cure (++), improvement (+), and insufficient clinical results (0). The population included patients with lesions ranging from four days to ten years, with a history of various previous treatments. The diagnosis was confirmed by direct microscopical examination and culture of skin scrapings, except in cases where the fungal origin was clinically evident. Concomitant oral treatment with miconazole nitrate was given to four patients.\\n\\nThe efficacy of the treatment was notable, with 83% (130 out of 157) of patients achieving a cure after a median treatment duration of four weeks. Specifically, cures were observed in 89% of patients with fungal infections, 67% of patients with gram-positive bacterial infections, and 86% of patients from whom no pathogens were isolated. The two patients with gram-negative bacterial infections showed improvement and insufficient clinical results. Additionally, concomitant oral treatment with miconazole nitrate contributed to the cure of three out of four patients.\\n\\nIn terms of safety, only one patient reported burning sensations and irritation after one week of topical treatment. No drug-related adverse reactions were observed, and there were no side-effects reported from the oral miconazole nitrate treatment.\\n\\nThe authors concluded that Daktacort cream is markedly effective in treating skin lesions of fungal origin with inflammatory symptoms, with a high cure rate and minimal adverse reactions. The results were superior to those recorded with previous treatments, and concomitant oral miconazole nitrate was beneficial in some cases.',\n",
