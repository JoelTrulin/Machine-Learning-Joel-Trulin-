The study included 20 patients with symptoms of a mycotic infection and marked inflammatory signs such as redness and itching. The median duration of symptoms was 2 years, with a range from 2 weeks to 20 years. Patients were treated with a cream containing 2% miconazole nitrate and 1% hydrocortisone, applied twice daily without the use of other medications for their condition. The treatment duration was 6 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by the presence of fungi and/or bacteria at the start, 5 days after, and 1 month after the end of therapy, as well as the evaluation of typical signs and symptoms at 2, 4, and 6 weeks of treatment.

The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Daktacort cream, which contains miconazole nitrate 2% and hydrocortisone 1%. Patients applied the cream twice daily for a median duration of four weeks, with extremes ranging from one week to 12 weeks. The clinical results were assessed at two-week intervals and scored as cure (++), improvement (+), or insufficient clinical results (0). The population included patients with lesions dating from four days to ten years, and the lesions were predominantly located on the feet, inguinocrural folds, and hands. Dermatophytes, yeasts, gram-positive bacteria, and gram-negative bacteria were among the pathogens identified. Concomitant oral treatment with miconazole nitrate was given to four patients.\\n\\nIn terms of efficacy, 83% (130 out of 157) of patients were scored cured after the treatment with Daktacort. Specifically, cures were observed in 89% of patients with fungal infections, 67% of patients with gram-positive bacterial infections, and 86% of patients from whom no pathogens were isolated. The two patients with gram-negative bacterial infections showed improvement and insufficient clinical results. Concomitant oral treatment with miconazole nitrate contributed to the cure of three out of four patients who received it.\\n\\nRegarding safety, only one patient reported burning sensations and irritation after one week of topical treatment. No drug-related adverse reactions were observed, and there were no side-effects reported with the concomitant oral miconazole nitrate treatment.\\n\\nThe authors concluded that Daktacort cream is markedly effective in treating skin lesions of fungal origin with inflammatory symptoms, achieving high cure rates across different pathogen etiologies. The results were superior to those recorded with previous treatments, and the addition of oral miconazole nitrate appeared to enhance the cure rate. Safety was considered acceptable, with minimal adverse reactions reported.',\n",

Above 44 different preparations had been prescribed a total of 126 times to these 80 patients. \\nThe results of this previous treatment were recorded in 72 patients as follows : marked improvement but with subsequent relapse in 6 ; moderate improvement in 8 ; minimal improvement in 24 ; no improvement in 34. \\nConfirmation of the clinical diagnosis was sought by direct microscopical examination and by culture of skin scrapings from all patients except 15 with eczema marginatum and one with candidosis, fungi being obviously the pathogenic agents. \\nSamples were cultured on Sabouraud PS\" and PSA mediums at 25° C. A few samples were additionally cultured on bacterial mediums. \\nRAll the patients were instructed to apply Daktacort cream twice daily to the affected area, and to come back for examination at two-week intervals. Duration of treatment varied according to the clinical results obtained. \\nThese results were scored as follows : cure (++), improvement (+), and insufficient clinical results (0). \\nResults \\nThe aetiology and localization of the lesions observed before RDaktacort treatment are given in Table 1.

TEGNER \\nDepartment of Dermatology, University of Lund, Lund, Sweden \\nABSTRACT \\nIn a double-blind study miconazole-hydrocortisone cream was compared with miconazole cream in 24 patients with symmetrical tinea cruris and tinea pedis. Treatment continued until total recovery was achieved at one or both sites or ceased after one month, if recovery was not achieved. At this time 21 lesions were cured with miconazolehydrocortisone and 11 with miconazole. The difference was statistically significant. \\nINTRODUCTION \\nAn anti-inflammatory component is often included in the topical treatment of tinea infections because inflammation is the symptom that causes the greatest discomfort. In the present study the anti-inflammatory and antimycotic effect of miconazole was compared with a miconazole-hydrocortisone combination in inflammatory tinea cruris and tinea pedis. \\nPATIENTS AND METHODS \\nTwenty-six patients with untreated dermatomycoses were selected for the trial. To be included in the trial patients had to exhibit bilateral symmetrical lesions with identical severity of symptoms of a given magnitude (see below). Diagnosis was made from a typical picture confirmed by positive microscopy for fungi (native potassium hydroxide preparations). At the first visit a sample was taken to identify the fungus (Table I). Twenty-five men and one woman, ranging in age from 16 to 65 years, were included in the study; six (five men, one woman) suffered from tinea pedis and 20 men from tinea cruris (inguinalis). \\nThe distribution of medication was randomized and the trial was conducted in a double-blind protocol. All patients received two tubes of cream with identical appearance, marked \"left\" and \"right.\" One cream contained 2% miconazole in the commercially available preparation \\n(Daktar and the other was of the same galenic formulation with the addition of 1% hydrocortisone. \\nPatients were instructed to apply creams twice daily on the indicated sites over the entire treatment period. No protective or occlusive bandages were used. Treatment continued until total recovery on one or both sides or ceased after one month, if recovery was not achieved. \\nThe morphology of the lesions was evaluated according to a graded scale of 1 to 5. Score 1 = intact skin with possible, very slight residual erythema; 3 = erythema and slight scaling but no infiltration; and 5 = pronounced changes with a marked erythema, papules or vesicles, infiltration, and scaling; 2 and 4 = intermediate stages. Patients with initial scores of 5 (23 patients) or 4 (three patients) were included in the study and were examined at two-week intervals. For statistical evaluation, a simple sign test was used. If the combination miconazole-hydrocortisone produced a better effect, a + sign was recorded. A - sign corresponded to a better effect produced by miconazole alone. No difference between medications was recorded as 0. Level of significance was 0.05. \\nThe difference between the initial and final score was evaluated using Wilcoxon\\'s rank sign test. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered as indicating a significant difference between the two medications. \\nRESULTS \\nTreatment was completed by 24 of 26 patients. Why two patients failed to complete the course of treatment is not known. \\nThe distribution of signs was 12 patients who responded better to miconazole-hydrocortisone therapy, no patients who responded better to miconazole alone, and 12 patients who showed no difference in response between medications (Table II). The difference is statistically significant. If the two dropout patients are included and given the least effective score (-), the difference is still significant. When the difference in score is evaluated using Wilcoxon\\'s test the results are the same, even if the two \\nTable II.

Two patients had minor and one patient had major residues of infection at the one-month check-up. The corresponding numbers for miconazole alone were 11 lesions cured, six with minor residues, three with major residues, and four cases of pronounced lesions. \\nNo side effects were observed by any patient with either of the two medications. \\nCONCLUSION \\nThe study demonstrates that the effect of a combination of miconazole and hydrocortisone was superior in clinical effect to miconazole alone in the \\ntreatment of tinea cruris and pedis. Twenty-one lesions were cured within one month with the combination, while only 11 lesions healed using miconazole. It must, however, be noted that the trial was interrupted as soon as healing on one side was achieved, usually the side treated with the combination. It can be concluded that the addition of hydrocortisone to miconazole in the treatment of inflammatory tinea infections is justified. The results concur with those previously reported in studies in which this weak steroid was added to miconazole.- 1 The risk of atrophy with such a preparation seems to be minimal. \\nMO \\nROS \\nDepar \\nReferences: \\n1.

These lesions had been existent in 13 patients for longer than one year, and in one exceptional case for fifteen years. \\nAll but eight patients had been previously treated with a wide variety of antibiotic, corticosteroid, antiseptic, antifungal or combination creams or lotions (Table I). \\nAssociated factors, one per patient, were as follows: dentures, seborrhoea, renal glucosuria, ingrowing toenails, diabetes and pregnancy. \\nAt selection, samples were taken from the patient for culture on two media: on maltose extract agar + chloramphenicol for 4 days at 37°C and then at 25° C; on peptone-glucose agar + actidione at 25°C. Samples were additionally taken from the majority of patients for bacterial culture at a local laboratory. \\nThe patients were treated topically with a combination of 2% miconazole and 1% hydrocortisone. Ear infections were treated once per day, hand infections twice per day, and foot and body infections two to three times per day. A plastic occlusive dressing was used in four cases of paronychia, and a non-plastic dressing in one other case.

Miconazole nitrate is an antimycotic that is effective, both in vivo and in vitro, against a great many pathogenic fungi and grampositive bacteria (1). The anti-inflammatory effect of hydrocortisone is known. Daktacort cream is indicated for the treatment of skin infections caused by dermatophytes or Candida species that involve inflammatory symptoms. Especially when it concerns dry, eczematous lesions a cream may cause irritation. In such cases a fatty ointment as base may be preferred. The purpose of this study is to show the efficacy and tolerability of Daktacort fatty ointment for the treatment of inflamed fungal infections. \\nAIM OF THE STUDY. \\nPatients. \\nFor this study, patients with skin infections caused by dermatophytes or Candida species were selected by the investigators. The infection had to involve inflammatory symptoms and have such a dry characteristic that an ointment was the appropriate vehicle for the active ingredients. Patients with bacterial or viral infections were excluded from this study, as were pregnant women. Other oral and/or topical treatments of the skin infections were not allowed during the study period. \\nMethod. \\nAfter selection each patient received 1 tube of Daktacort fatty ointment. The patient received instructions to thoroughly clean the skin before applying the fatty ointment. The use of antiseptic soap was not allowed for this. The patient was instructed to apply a small amount of the fatty ointment twice a day and to spread it thinly. The treatment must be continued until cured, however, no longer than 4 weeks. Two and four weeks after the treatment was initiated the patient was seen for follow-up. \\nAssessments. \\nBefore the patient was included in the study, the presence of dermatophytes or Candida species was established by microscopic assessment of a KOH preparation of flakes of the affected skin. If the microscopic test was positive and the patient was included in the study, personal information, the location of the lesion and a possible prior treatment with the obtained result were recorded. \\nThe presence of the symptoms itching, burning sensation, redness, flaking, swelling and exudation were scored with absent (0), doubtful (1), moderately pronounced (2) or significantly pronounced (3). At follow-up, 2 and 4 weeks after initiation of the treatment, the lesions were again assessed. In addition, the investigator gave an opinion on the result of the treatment (none - moderately successful - good - completely cured). \\nPossible side effects were also reported. If possible, the microscopic test was also repeated. \\nRESULTS. \\nPatients. \\nFor this study 120 patients were selected. Because of a missing microscopic assessment at the start of the study (5x) or a negative assessment (6x), the data of 11 patients was not included in the evaluation of the result of the study. Of two patients the results were not evaluated because of the antibiotic and/or antimycotic treatment of secondary infections, 4 and 6 days respectively after initiation of the study. The data of the patients included in the analysis are listed in table 1. A prior treatment for a similar disorder was reported for 35 patients. The result of this prior treatment was only provided in a single case and is therefore disregarded. For 34 of the 107 patients, treatment for 2 weeks was sufficient; 71 patients were treated for 4 weeks. Without stating a reason, two patients did not return for follow-up. \\nMicroscopic assessment. \\nAt the start of the study and when possible during the follow-up visits, the presence of dermatophytes and/or yeast cells were determined microscopically in a KOH preparation. In all patients the presence of either dermatophytes (80x), or yeasts (15x), or both species (12x) were shown at the start of the study. For the 34 patients, who were treated for 2 weeks, 2 patients were positive at follow-up (fig. 1, C). Of the 71 patients, who were treated for 4 weeks, only 3 patients were still found to be positive for dermatophytes in the KOH preparation (fig. 1, B) at the end of the study. This resulted in a mycological cure percentage of 95.2% (100/105) determined for all patients at the end of the study. \\nAssessment of symptoms. \\nThe severity of the symptoms was scored with absent (0), doubtful (1), moderately pronounced (2) or significantly pronounced (3) by the investigators. For the evaluation of the scores for the various symptoms and the total score, the patients were divided into groups based on the duration of the treatment (2 or 4 weeks). The sum of the scores of the separate symptoms per patient varied between 3 and 16; the average was 8.7. \\nThe evaluation of the total score of the symptoms for both groups is shown in figure 2. Noticeable is that the duration of the treatment shows a clear connection to the severity of the symptoms at the start of the study. The average starting score for patients treated for 4 weeks was statistically significantly higher (Mann Whitney U test, two-sided, p = 0.009) than for the patients treated for 2 weeks. The reduction in the symptoms was almost identical in both groups after 2 weeks of treatment. In the group of patients, who were treated for 2 weeks, an average total score per patient of 1.1 remained, which apparently was not a reason to continue the treatment. In the group of patients, who were treated for 4 weeks, the average total score per patient of 3.3 after 2 weeks improved to 0.8 after 4 weeks of treatment. The evaluation of the separate symptoms, divided by group, is given in figure 3. At the start of the study the symptoms itching, redness and flaking were assessed as pronounced (moderate + significant) in more than 80% of the patients. In general the symptoms burning sensation, swelling and exudation were assessed as less severe. Statistically all symptoms improved significantly (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed rank test, two-sided) (fig. 4, B), both in the separate groups and the total group. \\nGlobal assessment of the result. \\nAt the follow-up visits a global assessment of the result with none (0), moderately successful (1) or good (2) result or completely cured (3) was given by the investigators. The assessment did not depend on the location of the lesions (p>0.1; chi2 test). In the group of patients, who were treated for 2 weeks, (fig. 4, C) the treatment of 2 patients was assessed with \"no result\"; in one of these patients the total score for the symptoms changed from 5 to 6; in the second patient the total score went from 8 to 3 during the treatment. The result of the treatment was assessed as moderate in 4 patients and in 26 patients (81%) as good (4x) or completely cured (22x). In the group of patients, who were treated for 4 weeks, an evident development was observed at the assessment (fig. 4, B). After 4 weeks the result of the treatment was assessed as moderately successful in 3 patients and in 70 patients (96%) with good (24x) or completely cured (46x). An overview of the global assessments of all patients at the end of the study is given in fig. 4, A. In 9 patients (9%) the result of the treatment was assessed with \"none\" (2x) or \"moderately successful\" (7x) and in 96 patients (91%) with \"good\" (28x) or \"completely cured\" (68x). \\nSIDE EFFECTS. \\nNo side effects were reported. \\nDISCUSSION. \\nThe effectiveness of the combination miconazole nitrate/hydrocortisone (Daktacort) for the treatment of inflammatory fungal infections had been shown in previous studies. Mertens et.al. (2) compared the effectiveness of Daktacort with the effectiveness of the separate components in a double-blind study. Statistically Daktacort appeared significantly better after 1 week of treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment a cure percentage of 85.7% was reached. Fischman et.al. (3) assessed the result as very good in 93.3% of the patients after 4 weeks of treatment. These studies were performed with a cream as vehicle for the active ingredients. In case of dry, eczematous lesions, however, a fatty ointment may be preferred over a cream as vehicle. In this study the efficacy and tolerability of Daktacort fatty ointment was determined for the treatment of inflammatory fungal infections. The presence of fungi or yeasts was shown by microscopic assessment of a KOH preparation. At the end of the treatment (2 or 4 weeks) 5 patients were found to be positive. This gives a mycological cure percentage of 95.3%. Statistically, the scores for the separate symptoms and the total score reduced significantly during the treatment. The average total score per patient reduced from 8.7 to 0.9 at the end of the study. The result of the treatment was marked with a \"good\" or \"completely cured\" for 91% of the patients by the investigators. The results of this study show that a fatty ointment as vehicle for the active components miconazole nitrate and hydrocortisone is very effective and comparable to that of the cream as determined in previous studies (2, 3). The tolerability of Daktacort fatty ointment is good, as was shown by the absence of side effects. \\n',\n",

Schuller Dermatological Ward Town Hospital, Schiedam, The Netherlands \\nDr.M.S.den Boer Dermatological Whild (Signature) \\nSummary \\nIn an open study 19 patients with inflamed skin infections of bacterial Ror mycotic origin were treated with Daktacort A clear improvement of all symptoms was observed within a few weeks. After 6 weeks of treatment cultures were negative in 95 % of the cases, and also 1 month after the end of the therapy. \\nIntroduction \\nRRDaktacort is a combination of 2 % miconazole nitrate (Daktarin and 1 % hydrocortisone. The anti-inflammatory action of hydrocortisone is sufficiently known. Miconazole is a synthetic antimycotic (Godefroi et al. 1969) which is effective both in vitro and in vivo against the major pathogenic fungi and gram-positive bacteria (Van Cutsem and Thienpont, 1972; Sawyer et al. , 1975) . In a great number of studies the antimycotic (Botter, 1971ª; Gentles et al., 1975; Mandy and Garrot, 1974; Svejgaard, 1973) and the antibacterial effectiveness of miconazole (Botter, 1972; Dockx, 1972; Refai, 1974) in dermatologic affections have been evaluated. The great effectiveness of Daktacort has already been reported (Aussems band Van Cutsem, 1973; Aussems and Van Cutsem, 1974; Botter, 1971 ; Rieth, 1973) . A double-blind comparative study of Daktacort, miconazole and hydrocortisone (Mertens et al. , 1976) has demonstrated the mutually potentiating effect of miconazole and hydrocortisone. The number of relapses after miconazole has already been reported to be very low (Brugmans et al., 1970; Mandy and Garrot, 1974) . . This study was carried out because these data are not yet available for Daktacort. \\nPatients and methods \\n20 patients with symptoms of a mycotic infection and also with marked inflammatory signs (e.g. redness, itching, burning sensation) were included in the study. One selected patient, in whom neither culture nor microscopic examination could demonstrate any fungi or bacteria , did not return for follow-up. Therefore his data could not be analyzed. All data - sex and age of the patients, location of the lesions and microbiologic findings - are summarized in table I. The patients had these symptoms for a period varying from 2 weeks to 20 years (median : 2 years) . The patients had to apply the cream twice a day and were not allowed to use other medication for their affection. \\nAt the start of the investigation, 5 days after and 1 month after the end of the therapy, the presence of fungi and/or bacteria was assessed by means of a culture or a microscopic examination. Cultures of fungi were made on Sabouraud dextrose plates and cultures of bacteria on Littman Oxgall Agar ( Difco 0294-01). .The presence of the typical signs and symptoms (i.e. itching, burning sensation, redness, scaling, swelling and exsudation) was evaluated during selection and after 2, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment according to a 4-points\\' scale (O = absent; 1 = dubious; 2 = moderately pronounced; 3 = strongly pronounced) After 2, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment the investigator had to make a global evaluation according to a 4-points\\' scale (0 = no result; 1 = moderate result; 2 = favourable result; 3 = complete cure). \\nResults \\n5 days as well as 1 month after the end of the therapy, no more fungi or bacteria could be demonstrated by means of culture and/or microscopic examination in 18 patients (95 %) . One patient with a mixed infection by Staphylococcus aureus and Haemolytus streptococces group B did not show any clinical improvement and hence no more cultures or microscopic examinations were performed on him. In 15 patients (79 %) the investigator evaluated the global result as \"favourable\" or \"cured\"; see table II. In 3 patients, the global results of whom had been evaluated as \"moderate\", the skin affections were present for 4, 15 and 20 years respectively. The figure represents the evolution of the symptoms after 2, 4 and 6 weeks. In 10 patients (53 %) all symptoms had disappeared within 6 weeks. In 4 patients (21 %) two symptoms, and in 1 patient (5 %) three symptoms were still dubiously present after 6 weeks of treatment. In none of the cases were any side-effects mentioned. \\nConclusion \\nThe combination of 2 % miconazole nitrate and 1 % hydrocortisone in a dermatologic cream appears highly effective in the treatment of inflamed skin lesions of mycotic and/or bacterial origin. The figure demonstrates that typical inflammation signs such as redness, itching, burning sensation, and swelling are relieved rapidly. The antimycotic and antibacterial properties of miconazole nitrate are certainly not affected by hydrocortisone. Indeed, in 95 % of the cases the culture has become negative, and still was SO one month after the end of the therapy. . \\n',\n",
              "  'JohnsonJJhmen \\nNew Brunswick. NJ. October 5, 1976 file #107 \\nSubject: Study conducted by David Taplin to evaluate the efficacy of a miconazolehydrocortisone combination Project 1355.00 \\nSummary \\nThere are trends which suggest that the Combination Treatment is superior to Miconazole alone. By Day 7 both the Combination and Miconazole Treatments were dramatically superior to treatment with Hydrocortisone alone. \\nIntroduction \\nThe study was conducted in Columbia, South America at two separate military installations by David Taplin of the Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of Miami. The 48 patients from one installation participated in the study from June 10, 1976 through June 24, 1976, and the 51 patients from the other installation participated in the study from July 15, 1976 through July 28, 1976. Since the trends for each group of patients are similar, the groups have been combined in this report. \\nThe purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of a cream containing Miconazole nitrate and Hydrocortisone for the treatment of acute, moderate to severe symptomatic tinea corporis and tinea cruris. Following a random procedure, three (3) groups each containing 33 male patients were assigned to one of 1% Hydrocortisone/ 2% Miconazole nitrate cream, 1% Hydrocortisone cream, or 2% Miconazole nitrate cream. The products had \"blinded\" labels to assure that neither the investigator nor the patient being treated knew which formulation was being used. The appropriate medication was applied to each patient twice daily by the investigator or one of his staff for 14 days. \\nExclusions from the Summary \\nCoded medication was supplied to the investigator for the double-blind treatment of 99 patients. One additional patient was given commercial Miconazole nitrate by the investigator; however, information on this patient has been excluded from this summary. \\nA total of 10 patients from the Hydrocortisone Group were switched to commercial Miconazole Nitrate at various times following the Day 4 evaluation because their conditions worsened. Both the investigator and the clinical monitor feel that these patients should be counted as \"failures\" during later evaluations; however, since no direct information is available for these patients, they have been excluded from tables for visits after changing medication. \\nDemographic Information \\nThe patients in this study were all described as being male Caucasians. Their ages ranged between 18 and 28 years (Table 1) with the median age of 19 years for each treatment group. The diagnosis (Table 2) for most patients was a combination of Tinea cruris and Tinea corporis. The infecting organism (Table 6) was Epidermophyton floccosum in all by one patient. \\nSigns and Symptoms \\nGrades given for signs are summarized in Table 3 by classifing patients according to both the maximum grade and the most frequently occurring grade (mode). Thus, for example, the patient with one sign graded \"severe\" is distinguished from a patient with several signs graded \"severe\". Each day on which signs were graded is represented by a column in the table, and the \"p-value\" at the bottom of a column gives an indication of whether a difference exists among the three treatments for the day in question. In case a difference was suggested a test of significance was done to determine which pairs of treatments were different. Those treatments which are different at the 5 percent level of significance are indicated by pairs of initials. Those pairs different at the 10 percent level of significance are indicated by pairs of initials surrounded by parentheses. For this table and all subsequent tables the \"p-values\" were calculated using the Kruskal-Wallis Test (with the correction for ties) and the multiple paired comparisons were done using Dunn\\'s Technique. \\nTables 3A through 3G summarize grades given for each of the signs individually. Generally, there is a trend for the Combination to reduce the intensity of the signs more than Miconazole alone during the first four (4) days of treatment. By Day 7, both the Combination and Miconazole are clearly superior to Hydrocortisone alone. \\nGrades given for symptoms are summarized in Table 4 by classifing patients according to the maximum grade received. Individual symptoms are presented in Tables 4A, 4B, and 4C. It is readily apparent that the greatest involvement was with pruritis and that the trends for this symptom strongly influenced the trends in Table 4. These trends are similar to those noted for signs. \\nMicrobiological Determinations \\nTable 5 displays the results of KOH examinations made on Day 0, Day 7, and Day 14. On each of these days a culture was also taken, and these results are summarized in Table 6. For both tables by Day 7 the results are generally negative for the Combination and Miconazole treatments and generally positive for the Hydrocortisone treatment. \\nClinical Evaluations \\nTable 7 displays the investigator\\'s rating of the progress of treatment at each day of observation and Table 8 displays the overall clinical evaluations made on Day 7 and Day 14. In the first four days of treatment the trend is for the Combination treatment to result in more improved patients than the other treatments. By Day 7 both the Combination and the Miconazole Treatments resulted in improvement far superior to the Hydrocortisone Treatment. There was also a trend for the Combination Treatment to be superior to the Miconazole Treatment; however, the differences were not large enough for statistical significance. \\n*Median Age \\nDay 7 \\nDay 14 \\n',\n",

Inflamed dermatitis . Miconazole . Hydrocortisone . Daktacort R \\nAbstract. In a 4-week double-blind trial, Daktacort® cream was compared with each of its constituents (i.e. miconazole 2% and hydrocortisone 1%) in a total of 63 patients (aged 12-60 years) with inflamed skin infections of bacterial or mycotic origin. Daktacort treatment induced a significant improvement of all symptoms within 1 week and was superior to both miconazole and hydrocortisone in suppressing the inflammation. This tendency persisted throughout the trial but at the end miconazole treatment proved also superior to hydrocortisone. \\nIntroduction \\nDaktacort R is a combination of miconazole nitrate (Daktarin ) and hydrocortisone for dermatological use. \\nThe anti-inflammatory properties of hydrocortisone are well known. Miconazole is a synthetic antimycotic [12] which is highly effective against the most important pathogenic fungi and gram-positive bacteria [16, 19] in vitro and in vivo. It has proved an excellent tool in the treatment of mycotic [3, 5, 6, 8-11, 13-16, 18, 20, 21] and bacterial [5, 7, 16] skin infections. Successful treatment with Daktacort has already been reported as well [1-3, 17]. So far, no prospective study comparing Daktacort with its active constituents has been reported, presumably because it is generally accepted \\n1 We should like to thank Mr. J. VAN CUTSEM for the performance of the cultures. \\nMERTENS/MORIAS/VERHAMME \\nthat such drugs as hydrocortisone and miconazole are complementary in the treatment of inflamed skin infections. Nevertheless, we felt it of common interest to perform such a comparative trial and present here the results which we obtained. \\nMaterials and Methods \\nPatients \\n63 patients, 35 males and 28 females, with a median age of 30 years (range 12-60 years) were selected for the trial. All showed skin infections with prominent inflammation of one week's to 13 years' standing (median 1 month). Several symptoms suggestive of an inflamed skin infection (e.g. pruritus, burning sensation, erythema) were present in the majority of the patients. The data concerning sex and age of the patients, the duration of the infection, the location of the skin lesions and the microbiological findings are summarized in table I. More than 50% of the patients had a lesion of less than 1-month duration. \\nExperimental Design and Medication \\nFor this investigation we were supplied with a series of cream tubes ², containing the Daktacort combination or one of its constituents and all creams were identical in appearance. The tubes were individually numbered, their content being randomly determined. \\nEach patient was treated for 4 weeks with one of the creams, thus allowing a prospective comparison of three treatment regimens, i.e. Daktacort, miconazole, and hydrocortisone. Each patient was instructed to apply the cream twice every day. No other treatment was used during this trial. \\nAssessments \\nMicrobiology. At the start of the trial and again after 4 weeks, the presence of fungi was evaluated by culture and/or microscopic examination in all patients and specimens were grown on culture for detection of bacteria. \\nSymptom ratings. The presence of typical symptoms and signs (i.e. pruritus, burning sensation, erythema and inflamed appearance) was rated at selection and after 1 and 4 weeks of treatment using a 3-point scale (1 = severe; 2 = mild; 3 = absent). \\nGeneral appreciation of treatment effect. After 1 week of treatment and again 3 weeks later (end of trial) the investigator rated the overall effect of the treatment by means of a 5-point scale (1 = cure; 2 = marked amelioration; 3 = amelioration; 4 = no change; 5 = deterioration). \\n2The double-blind medication was kindly provided by Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium. The cream contained either 2% of miconazole nitrate, 1% of hydrocortisone, or both in a base identical to that of the commercially available Daktacort cream. \\nResults \\nBreaking the code revealed that 21 patients had been treated with Daktacort, 20 patients with miconazole, and 22 with hydrocortisone. \\nThe three treatment groups proved well comparable of sex, location of the lesions, results of microscopic examination and of culture (Fisher test), age, and duration of the skin infection (Mann-Whitney U-test). \\nMicrobiology Data (table II) \\nNone of the patients of both the Daktacort and the miconazole group, who had shown positive for fungi on microscopic examination at the start, were still positive at the end of the trial, in contrast to 11 of the 14 dermatophyte-positive patients who remained positive after hydrocortisone treatment. These data were largely confirmed by culture. \\nThe results were similar in the patients with bacterial infections: 0 of 6 Daktacort patients, 2 of 7 miconazole patients, and 6 of 8 hydrocortisone patients still had the same bacteria at the end of the trial. Therefore, as proved by the microscopic examinations as well as the culture findings, the Daktacort and the miconazole treatment showed significantly superior to hydrocortisone (p<0.001; Fisher test, two-tailed probability) at the end of the trial. \\nMERTENS/MORIAS/VERHAMME \\nSymptom Ratings \\nDaktacort treatment induced a significant amelioration of all items within 1 week of treatment (p <0.001, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test, one-tailed), whilst in the same period only pruritus and burning sensation had clearly ameliorated with hydrocortisone (p<0.05, same test) and only pruritus with miconazole (p<0.05, same test). Thus, 1 week of Daktacort treatment showed superior to miconazole as regards pruritus and erythema (p<0.01, Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-tailed two-sample test), whilst superiority to hydrocortisone after 1 week was limited to erythema (p<0.05, same test). \\nAt the end of the trial, all symptoms had significantly (p<0.05, Wilcoxon test as above) ameliorated in the three treatment groups, except for erythema in the hydrocortisone-treated group. Moreover, the end result revealed that Daktacort was superior to both miconazole and hydrocortisone in suppressing the inflammation (p<0.001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, as above) and superior to hydrocortisone as regards the disappearance of erythema (p<0.001, same test). Also, by that time miconazole showed superior to hydrocortisone in respect of the effect on erythema (p<0.01, same test). \\nGeneral Appreciation (table III) \\nAt the end of the 1st week of treatment, Daktacort appeared to have had a more favourable effect on the infections than either miconazole (p<0.01) or hydrocortisone (p<0.05), the difference between the latter two types of treatment being non-significant. \\nThe superiority of Daktacort to both miconazole and hydrocortisone was maintained at the end of the trial (p<0.05), but by that time miconazole treatment proved also superior to hydrocortisone (p<0.05). This is further evidenced by the cure rates which were as follows: 85.7% with Daktacort, 40.0% with miconazole, and 4.5% with hydrocortisone. \\nDiscussion and Conclusion \\nThe present trial has confirmed the suspected mutually potentiating effects of miconazole and hydrocortisone in inflamed skin infections. Daktacort, therefore, should be considered a valuable tool in the treatment of such dermatological disorders, the more so since our study has shown that this new drug combination provides rapid and optimal relief in patients with inflamed skin infections, both by its rapid effect upon the inflammation \\nMERTENS/MORIAS/VERHAMME \\nphenomena (largely due to hydrocortisone) and its high efficacy against the causative agent (due to miconazole). \\n\"],\n",
